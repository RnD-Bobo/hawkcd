# Hawk UI

### Main Technologies

Hawk uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Metronic](http://www.keenthemes.com/preview/metronic/) - "THE MOST COMPLETE & TRUSTED ADMIN THEME"

And of course Hawk itself is NOT YET open source with a [private repository](https://github.com/rndsolutions/hawk-ui)
 on GitHub. ! Only RnD Solutions Members allowed.
